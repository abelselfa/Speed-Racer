# Features
-We have created a randomized track of rings that change every time you retry the race.

-The color of the rings changes so you know at all times which rings you already reached, what's the next ring and the FINISH LINE.

-Theres also an arrow that always points to the next ring. It changes color depending on the relative position to the next ring.

-You can get hit by an asteroid at any time. You respawn at the nearest checkpoint.

-You can retry the game after winning or exit.
